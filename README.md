# KAN
KAN (Kevin's Account aNalyzer) is a personal tool aimed to analyze bank account statements
and update a remote Google Sheet with categorized transactions.

It uses a simple ETL architecture to extract data from the bank's
PDF statements, transform the data by categorizing transactions against
a known set of categories, and load the results into a Google Sheet.
